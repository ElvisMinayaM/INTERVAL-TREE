# INTERVAL TREE

## Overview
An interval tree can be used to efficiently find a set of numeric intervals overlapping or containing another interval.

This library provides a basic implementation of an interval tree using C++ templates, a presentation (.pptx) developing step-by-step methods to add; delete;search; computational cost, use cases.

## Use of the demo
The demo is implemented in the c++11 language, the use and compilation is simple.
Copy all the code from intervaltree.cpp and paste it into your favorite program, compile and go.

## Dependencies (windows)
g++ 11 and graphviz

## Contributions
